1. Install gcc-fortran to get gfortran compiler:
 sudo zypper install gcc-fortran

2. Add science repository
 sudo zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/science/SLE_11_SP3/science.repo

4. Install lapack, if not already installed. 
 sudo zypper search lapack
 - I had liblapack3 installed, but no ideas where it was. 
 sudo zypper install lapack-devel
 - this asked for a number of repo ownership changes, but these all looked fine. 
 - Now -llapack seems to work fine.

5. Install openblas and lapack
 sudo zypper search openblas
 sudo zypper install openblas-devel

6. Note that these libraries are in /usr/lib64

7. Also install arpack, superlu and atlas. Make sure you've got the devel version of each library, too. 

sudo zypper install libatlas3-sse3-devel
sudo zypper install arpack-ng-devel

With all of these libraries, the compiled .mexa64 mex file should work fine.










####### BELOW FOR BUILDING FROM SOURCE ########

8. If needing to build from source, downaload armadillo.  Untar armadillo, run cmake . and make and sudo make install

9. You'll also need to make sure you've a c++ compiler. You can get one using sudo zypper install gcc43-c++, which installs the program g++-4.3 (have a look in /usr/bin).
   You'll have to change the name of CC in the makefile to reflect your compiler, obviously. 

Run the makefile from inside the linux subfolder. 



##### BELOW ONLY FOR C++11 FANCIES
 
9. If needing c++11, we need gcc>4.7, then clang. - note that build of gcc5.3 failed. As did gcc4.8.5. As did gcc4.7.4. David Rhodes suggests that it's not possible....
 #sudo zypper install gmp-devel
 #sudo zypper install mpc-devel
 #sudo zypper install mpfr-devel
 cd ~/src
 svn checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/tags/gcc_5_3_0_release gcc-5.3.0
 mkdir gcc-5.3.0-build
 cd gcc-5.3.0 ./contrib/download_prerequisites
 cd gcc-5.3.0-build
 $PWD/../gcc-5.3.0/configure \
    --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-5.3.0 \
    --program-suffix=-5.3.0       \
    --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran \
    --disable-multilib
 make -j$(nproc)
 sudo make install


2. Get OpenBLAS - NOT NECESSARY
 wget https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git

3. Install OpenBLAS - NOT NECESSARY
 Untar. In folder, type make FC=gfortran and sudo make install. 
 Key files are in /opt/OpenBLAS/lib and /opt/OpenBLAS/include
